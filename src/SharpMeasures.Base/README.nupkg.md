# SharpMeasures.Base

The base of [SharpMeasures](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpMeasures/), without any quantities and units. Can be used together with [SharpMeasures.Generators](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpMeasures.Generators/) to construct a set of quantities and units from scratch.

See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SharpMeasures/sharp-measures-base) for more information.
